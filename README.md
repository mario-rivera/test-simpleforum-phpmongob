## Prerequsites
I'm using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) to deploy the application

## Installation
- Preferably from a UNIX based OS run the install.sh script. 
- Run bash ./install.sh 
- This will build the docker image and run the containers.
- Go to localhost:9999 to view the application.
